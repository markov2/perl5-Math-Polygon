Revision history for Perl extension Math::Polygon

version 0.004: Fri Jul 21 10:17:44 CEST 2006

	- simplify() could get in an endless loop.

	- doc updates to fit into Geo::Point doc-set.

	- ring detection failed in Calc::polygon_start_minxy(), reported
	  by [mtworek]

version 0.003: Fri Dec  3 13:20:37 CET 2004

	- simplify will average close points.  Before, points could get
	  removed one after the other, until points over a long distance
	  were stripped.  That will not happen anymore.

	- polygon_start_minxy/Math::Polygon::startMinXY now returns the
	  point most close to (xmin,ymin) of the bounding box first. Was
	  the point with the smallest x.

	- new method Math::Polygon::contains(point) and function
	  Math::Polygon::Calc::polygon_contains_point(point, @poly)
	  with tests in t/14contains.t

version 0.002: Fri Nov 12 16:05:18 CET 2004

	- Created Math::Polygon::Transform, and added loads of test for it

	- Math::Polygon added interface to transform routines

version 0.001: Wed Sep  1 17:45:51 CEST 2004
